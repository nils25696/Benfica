# SL Benfica Master Thesis Project

Welcome to the Benfica repository! This repository contains the key documents from my master thesis, including a Jupyter Notebook and a Power BI file. The goal  of my thesis was to develop an HR data visualization strategy for Sport Lisboa e Benfica to optimize the clubâ€™s KPI reporting, while putting a strong emphasis on the design and effects of compensation and benefits. The shared documents in this repository provide comprehensive insights related to my work.

## Contents
#### Jupyter Notebook
Due to data privacy reasons, Benfica could not provide me with their actual HR data, which is why I had to generate random data by myself, using Python. The entire data generation process can be seen in this file.

#### Power BI File
From the previously generated random data I developed five dashboards, covering the areas of compensation, benefits, recruitment, performance and fluctuaton. These dashboards aimed to provide Benfica with new approaches to track, structure and visualize different HR KPI's.
